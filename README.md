Fix-Outlook-Shared-Deleted
==========================
Issue: An email deleted from a shared mailbox in Outlook appears in the users deleted items instead of the shared mailboxesâ€™ deleted items.

Solution: Close Outlook, run this script, then open Outlook.

It will work for both Outlook 2010 (14) and Outlook 2013 (15).
